Installation
============

The  BCML manual is divided into two parts: the XML schema which is needed to write files that are compliant to the specification, and the utilities that are needed to manipulate, validate and export the data.

XML Schema
----------

To use the XML Schema, there is no need of installation. Simply copy the XSD and XML files from the schema archive in a directory of your choice and you will be already ready to use them.

Utility programs
----------------

BCML also offers a series of utilities to perform various operation on BCML schema compliant XML files (see XXX). In order to use them, you need to have the `Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) <http://www.java.com>`_ installed already, at least version 1.6.  For Linux systems, the tools were only tested for Sun Java Virtual Machine.

Once this prerequisite is met, you need to download the utility archive (a ZIP file or a TGZ file, depending on your operating system), unpack it to a directory of your choice. The utility files are in the ``bin`` directory and can be used directly through the command prompt (Windows), a shell (Linux) or the Terminal (OS X). To uninstall the utilities, simply delete the folder.
