Introduction
============

The **Biological Connection Markup Language** is an XML based data format to represent, annotate, filter and analyze biological pathways. It is implemented as an XML schema coupled with a group of utilities to manipulate and export the format. The use of an XML schema ensures flexibility from a computational perspective, and also the possibility of manipulation, representation, and adjustments of the data in a consistent way. 

Pathways described in BCML can be used for computational analysis, or converted into a graphical representation useful for publication and data interpretation.

BCML is fully compliant to the `Systems Biology Graphical Notation specification <http://www.sbgn.org>`_, as proposed by Le Novere *et al.* [LeNovere2009]_. It is an implementation of the Process Description (PD) 1.1 specification.

BCML was developed as a joint effort of the Duccio Cavalieri group at the University of Firenze (Italy) and the Sorin Draghici group at the Wayne University (USA).
